# Creative Making: Advanced Visualisations <br> & Computational Environments

## SoulNet (Project Introduction)

SoulNet is an interactive installation created by **Adam Code, Alexandre Tarek,  Lea Ho, Lexin Zhou, Orsolya Szantho, Sali Mallat, and Sixiong Sheng.**  It is a critical exploration of the relationship between our engagement with virtual worlds and our physical freedom. The interactive installation stages a fictional demo set in the near future, asking us to consider which parts of our physical reality are we willing to give up in order to experience a promised virtual paradise.

## Disclaimer

This project was brought to life with the effort and hardwork of **seven** awesome people at CCI, UAL. This repository will include **only the write up of my contribution in this project and personal documentation of the process.** The code and project files are not included in this repo, but I have attached a link below to the repo that contains all the code and project files for a holistic view of every member's efforts to bring this project to life.

## Personal Write-up

For the final iteration of this installation, I was involved in both the physical and the virtual development. To start with the unreal part of the project, I was responsible for creating the graphics and overall design of the game. I created the materials, particle systems, modeled the game objects and animated them on Blender. The challenge of creating the graphics and effects was achieving a design that is impressive enough to keep the user engaged, even addicted to the gameplay. The user engagement was a very important factor through out the decision making process of putting the graphics together and what kind of mood and vibe the game communicated. This is because the installation forces users to position themselves in awkward and uncomfortable positions to play and interact with the virtual game. Therefore, the actual gameplay needed to be powerful and smooth to keep them playing and engaged. In other words, it was a situation of whether or not the user is willing to give up comfort to keep playing and make more pretty graphics. From the response we had at the show, the answer is yes, most people are more than willing to give up comfort and restrain their movements to keep exploring the virtual world.

As our game had only one camera angle / perspective, I wanted to add a layer dimensionality to an otherwise flat two-dimensional world. To delve slightly deeper into the technical side of things, I would say the biggest game changer for the graphics of the game was the introduction of the dynamic trail or the dynamic ribbon system. Through various iterations and after numerous tutorials on particle systems, creating and merging materials, I was able to create dynamic materials that animate overtime to avoid a static and flat look. The trail is an example of that dimensionality and dynamic design as it is constantly shifting, animating, and gracefully flowing around the space the longer the user engages with the installation.
